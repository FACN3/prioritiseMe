## USER STORIES
As a user I want to write an entry in a todo app

As a user I want to set a priority for my entry

As a user I want to know how long I have been in the process of doing the todo entry

As a user I want the ability to delete entries

As a user I want to select my username and see previously entered todos

## HOW
Prioritise Me will create a database, which will contain a schema seperating tables into a user table and a task table.

A server will connect to the database and via queries, pull data from the database and display it via a DOM function.



## ARCHITECTURE MAP

## PLAN
* Write readme
* Write skeleton files and folders
* Write index.html
* Write all functions (server, router, fetch, handler, queries, build_script, dom)
* Server testing
* Script injection protection
* Db testing
* Heroku db implementation
* Travis
* Mobile first css



## STRETCH GOALS

Implement a start/stop button on the website which will modify the task table in the database and create a value which shows how long the tasks has been in process for.
